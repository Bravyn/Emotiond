# Emotiond stands for Emotion daemon. I visualized it as an app/service that runs in the background.
#It responds to specific inbuilt commands, currently it exists as a telegram bot that you can interact with in a number of ways
#Go over to telegram and search Emotiiond, send "hello"(lowercase, no quotes)the response.
